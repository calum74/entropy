Distribution generation

Although Knuth-Yao and the interval algorithm are optimal for generating single integers, they are not optimal in the amortised case, because they always have an entropy loss, or toll, of up to 2 bits per integer generated. For example to roll a d6, the entropy required is $\log_26 \approxeq ...$, but the Knuth-Yau algorithm requires $...$ bits on average.

To achieve an efficiency closer to 1, various batching schemes have been devised.
